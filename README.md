# Physician-Partners---Outliers-Detection
Physician Partners Data Science Project

Assignment
You need to create an algorithm that can find outliers in the data by one column / several columns. E.g., some members have extremely high costs for the current month and your solution should be able to detect such records. Think about features and how you would explain them to business people. All financial columns contain the $ sign.

This project aims to accomplish this.
